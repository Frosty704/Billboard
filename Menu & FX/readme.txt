If you're interested in using the gesture based image swapping for the windows 11 board, you will need to merge the W11 FX Controller,

and then edit the windows 11 board material under the "Decals" section
You may have to change the position values

Main texture - Neutral, Fist (Keep the texture, but add the image to "Your Image Here") 

For the decals, it should only be the image itself

Decal 0 - Hand Open

Decal 1 - Fingerpoint

Decal 2 - Victory (peace sign)

Decal 3 - Thumbs Up
