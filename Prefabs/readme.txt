For a small variety of gifs/flipbooks I included, check the Resources folder

Texture sheets with emotes for either TextboxSTT or TTS-Voice-Wizard can be found in the resources folder. Simply swap the material of the "Text" mesh found under KillFrenzyAvatarText -> Constraint -> Text

Audio notification upon message send can be found in the resources folder, drag in the Audio gameobject to KillFrenzyAvatarText -> Constraint 

The Back Hide gameobject in Prefabs can be attached to your spine, however will only work with TTS-Voice-Wizard with replay KAT off, as otherwise the message refreshes and board reappears
