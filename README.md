# Frosty's Billboard

Frosty's billboard is a container for the KAT (KillFrenzyAvatarText) https://github.com/killfrenzy96/KillFrenzyAvatarText
allowing you to have a chatbox in your hand with the ability to drop it in the world, anchoring it there, resizing it, grabbing and moving it around with your right (or left!) hand or just having it constrained to your neck like a speech bubble! This is best used in tandem with Wizard's TTS-Voice-Wizard, an OSC program allowing speech to text outputting to the KAT! https://github.com/VRCWizard/TTS-Voice-Wizard
