# Frosty's Billboard


Frosty's billboard is a container for the [KAT (KillFrenzyAvatarText)](https://github.com/killfrenzy96/KillFrenzyAvatarText)
allowing you to have a speech bubble in your hand with the ability to drop it in the world, anchoring it there, resizing it, grabbing and moving it around with your right hand or just having it move with your head like a speech bubble!

It uses 394 polygons, 3 material slots, (4 including the KAT) and 11 bits of parameter space.


# TTS-Voice-Wizard
This is best used in tandem with Wizard's TTS-Voice-Wizard, an OSC program allowing speech to text (or text to text) outputting to the KAT! https://github.com/VRCWizard/TTS-Voice-Wizard
